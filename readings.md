The article does a good job summarizing the evolving perception of AR through the years. AR started as explorations with Head-mounted display systems (HMDs). Combined with the advancement and later ubiqiuity of mobile devices, visual augmentation has become the dominant area of focus within the field. The authors argue that this focus shrowds our understanding of other AR definitions and uses in terms of alternative sensory augmentations, and as a medium for broader
creative expression. 

The article revolves around Azuma's defintion of AR, which is a combination of three key characteristics: (1) combining real and virtual, (2) real-time interactivity and (3) 3D registration.Though the authors themselves define AR as real-time computationally mediated perception, in the context of expressive media for computational arts. They argue that AR art invites multimodal design practices and well as collaboration. "We locate art and expression as a set of relations between experience, materials and environment—all physical, digital, symbolic—as languages from which new knowledge and new modes of communication are made possible."

The authors reference some early and contemporary artworks which they consider to use AR as primary medium. I looked into the Augmented Hand Series (2014) [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K-8kPmimog&ab_channel=Libertar.io), which creates transformations of the real world. The participant sees a reimagined view of their hand when placed in a viewer. Some examples from the video include:
- Procrustes: all fingers are equalized to the same length
- Breathing palm
- Angular exaggeration
- Springers: movements are exaggerated  by a physical simulation
- Lissajous: The palm is warped in a periodic way

The piece was really interesting, especially as participants are forced to see the augmented hand as their own. It reminded me of the [Body Transfer Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_transfer_illusion). I wonder how strange it would feel to watch something so familiar like your hand move in unpredictable ways.

The authors summarize questions from a two-day Forum for Augmented Reality Immersive Instrument (ARImI), which focused on exploring the potential for broader multidisciplinary applications in AR.

- Combination of real and virtual
  - **How will mediations be temportally connected?**
- Real-time interactivity
  - **How is the role of the participant changing in AR art?**
  - **How will participants express themselves?**
- 3D registration
  - **What is the nature of augmentation? does it mean layering, mediation?**
- Mediated perception
  - **Which senses will be medited?**
  - **How might AR alter cognition?** I think the augmented hand series demonstrates the potential for AR-altered cognition

The authors cite a quote from Conor McGarrigle - "Augmented Reality is a problematic term in itself but we're stuck with it". I found the [article](https://journals.gold.ac.uk/index.php/lea/article/view/113/87) and apparently the term AR was originally coined in 1992 for applications in aircraft manufacturing at Boeing. In the 1990s it was associated with virtual reality type headsets. According to McGarrigle "the Hud as a model of AR still exists in the nostalgia of "yesterday's tomorrows."" He mentions that the AR is situated somewhere along real-virtual continuum, which serves to place the practice in a secnario that looks towards the utopian ambitions of VR, and as such "runs the risk of not attending to the real value of AR, which is its ability to contextually situate data". The article is called Augmented Resistance: the possibilities for AR and data driven art. It's actually really fascinating and I'll post a summary here soon.
