## Meetings (Tuesdays @ 11am PST/2pm EST)
### 9/21/2021
Notes
- Object recognition is cool
- Would also be cool to hit a surface with drum sticks and have sound play
- Giving extra affordances to physical objects?
- How can this tie into live coding? What would a performance look like?
- What hardware affordances do we have with the HoloLens as opposed to phones?
- Need to focus on why it's special in AR? E.g. why not in VR?
- Include projection mapping onto the objects
- Readers: Maybe Josh/Gillian?
