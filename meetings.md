## Meetings

### 11/19/2021
- "Stomp"
- Linear interpolation to slow down playback
- walk path
- Divide between the progeamming and embodiment
- Does this tool need to be modal in the same way?
- Language vs system of controls
- some formalism behind it
- classify operations to justify it as a language
- interface, music/art related conferences (NIME)
- programming lang, could target other conferences
- NIME deadline is Feb
- what if we want to easily scale and quantize noise
- gradient to scale noise function
- define language

Action Items
- Meet sometime on Monday
- Create aa Google doc defining all the operations


### 11/12/2021

Action Items
- Next week meet at 11am PST/2pm EST
- Next week show sound
- Find more performances/examples of wave terrain synthesis
- Decide on reader, email thesis summary
- Follow up on Shoggoth repo

Paper
- Maybe organise related work thematically, e.g. wave synthesis, livecoding & VR
- Explore wave synthesis in background section, refer to pioneers in the field
- Are we going to have a language component?
- Find more examples

### 10/29/2021
- CodeKlavier: https://github.com/cappelnord/codeklavier-ar

### 10/12/2021
- evaluate performance?
  - what did audience think? did they understand? did they enjoy?
- evaluate system?
  - what affordances do I have now that I didn't have before - compare to other systems.
- contaxt DxArts at UW to see about joining speaker series
- livesteam static camera

Paper
- background
  - hololens history
  - hololens applications
  - AR performances
    - dancing
    - CARL
  - VR performances
  - language -> soem formalizism for tokens -> body languaguage, nodes, voice, text
    - how they're combined, tree, generate outputs in the end

Thesis Info

The thesis proposal should be completed within the first three credits of thesis credit. It constitutes a formal written document that describes the research area, identifies the research question, situates the work in the context of related work, describes the research methods to be used, and how the research question will be answered. The advisor and reader must approve the written proposal before an oral presentation can be scheduled. 

The oral presentation consists of a 15 minute talk and 5 minute public Q&A period that is open to the public, and then a 10 minute question and critique period from IMGD Steering faculty.




### 10/5/2021
- Fractal noise for terrain generation, https://thebookofshaders.com/13/
- CARL would be a good paper reference
- Looking for paper about HoloLens dance performance... couldn't find one :(
- https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/16/7259/pdf
- metal note, talk about thesis next time 
- end of semester, backgrounds and proposal

### 9/21/2021
Notes
- Object recognition is cool
- Would also be cool to hit a surface with drum sticks and have sound play
- Giving extra affordances to physical objects?
- How can this tie into live coding? What would a performance look like?
- What hardware affordances do we have with the HoloLens as opposed to phones?
- Need to focus on why it's special in AR? E.g. why not in VR?
- Include projection mapping onto the objects
- Readers: Maybe Josh/Gillian?

Action Items
- Look into AR performances and collect notes
- Read https://direct.mit.edu/leon/article/53/3/263/96873/What-Does-Augmented-Reality-Mean-as-a-Medium-of
  - Think about 4 categories at the end - does a framework need more?
- Explore [Wave Terrain Synthesis](https://electronicmusic.fandom.com/wiki/Wave_terrain_synthesis)
- Continue working on Object Recognition
- Investigate LiDAR potential - how detailed can we get?
- Try out some basic terrain generation in Unity
